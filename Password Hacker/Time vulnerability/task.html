<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Your program has successfully hacked the new system! However, the admin noticed it because your first failed attempts have been noticed: so the admin found the vulnerability and made a patch. You should overcome this patch and hack the system again. It’s not easy being a hacker.</p>

<p>The admin has improved the server: the program catches the exception and sends a simple ‘wrong password’ message to the client even when the real password starts with current symbols.</p>

<p>But here's what he didn't expect: probably, he just catched this exception. We know that catching an exception takes a lot of time for a computer, so there should be a delay in the server response when this exception takes place. You can use it to hack the system: count the time period in which the response comes and find out which starting symbols work out for the password.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should write a program that uses the time vulnerability to find the password.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use the list of logins from the previous stage.</li>
	<li>Output the result as you did this in the previous stage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code>&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; python hack.py localhost 9090
{
    "login" : "su",
    "password" : "fTUe3O99Rre"
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; python hack.py localhost 9090
{"login": "admin3", "password": "mlqDz33x"}</code></pre>

<h2><strong>Hint</strong></h2>

<p>To understand where the exception is you should count the time period of each response. If the delay of some attempt is considerably longer than delay on the other attempts, it is almost certainly mean that the server was busy catching this exception and you know that the correct password starts with this attempt. To get the time difference between two execution points in code you actually can subtract one <code>datetime</code> object from another like in the following example: </p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from datetime import datetime

start = datetime.now()
...
finish = datetime.now()
difference = finish - start</code></pre>
